And lets begin, I've decided to return to blogging, but this time I decided to blog only in English, so I can practice more my writing skills.

This blog is hosted on [Posterous](http://posterous.com/). I thought about writing a simple blog using some language I don't know much yet, but it would take some of my precious time from working on [DeskMetrics](http://deskmetrics.com/). I thought about building it using Django and a simple blog app like django-articles, which I've done a thousand times already so, forget about it! Setting up WordPress on my domain? Not learning much too, so lets give [Posterous](http://posterous.com/) a shot and see if it'll work for me. If not, I'll probably try to build some thing from scratch.
